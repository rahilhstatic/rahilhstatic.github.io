    <h1>NextCampus</h1>
    <p class="intro">Designed a custom ERP system for educational institutions to manage admissions, exams, and employee payroll. 
	The admissions module has both students and staff sides respectively, while the other features were built only for internal use.</p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>I initially joined as an intern, but was soon promoted to a junior designer role as I continued to lead the entire design process. 
	Working as the sole designer in a fast-paced startup environment, I handled everything from user flows to high-fidelity UIs. 
	As the complexity increased in year 2, another designer helped me with wireframes and user flows. </p>

     <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Lot of existing ERP systems in the market meant that NextCampus had to be different. It aims to cater to many different users.
    From admins, teachers and students to staff members and invigilators for exams. 
    All this meant a complex app where it was crucial to understand each role and their requirements. 
    On top of that our target audience was not technologically oriented, so the product must be made with that in mind.</p>
	  
    <h2>Process & Approach</h2>
    <p>Collaborated with stakeholders to understand workflows and pain points, then translated them into clear user flows and wireframes. 
	Built high-fidelity UIs and interactive prototypes, iterating based on feedback from all the different user types. 
	Tested multiple builds with real users to ensure that the product was easy to understand, navigate and use.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The ERP system helped reduce manual processes, simplified exam and payroll management, and improved transparency across departments. 
	It’s currently in active use in a few colleges in India and has received positive feedback for its clarity and ease of use. 
	The product also generated significant revenue numbers as the parent company was able to expand their branches across the city.</p>
