    <h1>WorkIn</h1>
    <p class="intro">A multi-sided talent acquisition platform connecting recruiters, universities, and candidates. 
	Designed to support direct and mediated (university-assisted) job applications.</p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>After being explained the vision and scope of the product, I independently led the end-to-end product design which includes user research, UX/UI design, design system and workflow architecture.
    This was done for all three user types: recruiters, universities, and candidates.</p>

     <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Workin is a three-sided talent acquisition platform that aims to connect recruiters, agencies and candidates, each with their
	respective needs and goals which sometimes conflicted with other users. The challenge was in resolving these conflicts amicably through strategic design choices.</p>
	<p><b>Candidates</b> wanted privacy and complete control over their individual applications.
	<b>Agencies</b> partnered with select universities wanted to apply on behalf of students to job openings, they wanted an efficient way to onboard students without the data entry hassle. 
	<b>Companies</b> wanted quality applications for openings without spam, duplication and with clear segregation in data.</p>

    <h2>Process & Approach</h2>
    <p>Mapped out the three-sided dynamics of the product to note places where there was a conflict of interest, 
	then designed mechanisms to counter the imbalance where priorities clashed.
	
	<p class="para2"><b>Key Design Decisions:-</b></p>
	<p><b>Student Autonomy vs Agency Efficiency:</b> Created a way for agencies to onboard students directly from partnered universities into various groups via a special invitation link (groups would be named by the agency, each with its own unique link). 
	Each student at their own discretion could sign-up using that link to allow agencies to handle the applications on their behalf, or 
	if a student wanted to maintain complete autonomy they could simply opt-out of that system and sign-up on their own without any agency intervention. 
	This maintained the efficiency for agencies while giving students the freedom to self-manage their applications.</p>
	<p><b>Quality Control Through Partnerships:</b> To prevent spam applications to job openings (both through agencies and autonomous applications) a partnership system was created which allowed a company to post a job listing which would only be visible to a partnered agency of their choosing. This was called a tie-up. Companies could create private job postings for these agencies through a tie-up.</p>
	<p><b>Modular Feature Architecture: </b> Built the platform with flexibility in mind as the feature list and requirement continued to grow. The late addition of resume builder and mock exam creation tools were integrated seamlessly with the existing system without disrupting core functionality.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Delivered a fully-integrated product design with seamless cross-user interaction. 
    The design supports flexible recruitment strategies and demonstrates scalable UX for complex B2B2C use cases. The system launched successfully serving the three different user types.</p>
	<p>I departed shortly after completion and don't have any post-launch metrics as a result. I would have been interested in knowing how many candidates actually used the resume builder vs the default job profile, there was room for optimization there. </p>
